Introduction:
Good [morning/afternoon], [Manager's Name]. Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today for my mid-year review. I'd like to highlight the key contributions and achievements from January to June 2024, and how they align with our team's priorities and the broader strategic initiatives of the bank.

Onboarding and Initial Contributions:
I joined the TESLA Team (RCL Core functions) towards the end of 2023. With the support of my colleagues, I quickly gained a comprehensive understanding of the core functions. 

In January, I was tasked with helping ESG, a new tenant, onboard onto CRC. Collaborating with Bhushan and Aditya from the Maserati team, we devised a solution to use the MDU API as an interim data source, enabling us to publish data to CRC despite the upstream source (EOS) not being ready. This was my first significant contribution to TESLA.

- Highly around MT (ESG) additional to OCP4
- Enhancement in delivered short time (OTT) 

Collaboration and Innovation:
A notable achievement was our rapid response to a feature request for APAC Prod. Working closely with Bhushan, we developed the feature within 24 hours, leveraging GitHub Co-pilot to enhance coding efficiency. The feature was tested in UAT and deployed to PROD by the end of the week, demonstrating our commitment to agile practices and production stability.

Enhancements and Support:
Since then, I've implemented several enhancements within MDU, including dynamic HDFS allocation and configuration restructuring. Additionally, I supported ESG, along with Aditya from the Maserati team, to go live in production last week.

Training and Recognition:
At the beginninghe year, I contributed to recording training sessions and creating training materials for new CRC members. This effort was appreciated by Raj and underscores our focus on talent development and knowledge sharing.

In February, I was recognized in the Reporting Domain Excellence shoutout for my work in EMEA. This recognition reflects our commitment to delivering business outcomes and benefits.

Promotion and Leadership:

In March, I was promoted from Senior Analyst to Associate, for which I am grateful. As a co-lead of the TDI India Junior Network Working Group, I had the opportunity to meet Khurshed in person. He appreciated my contributions and proposed expanding the TDI India Junior Network to an India-wide Junior Network, with me leading this initiative.

I was also nominated for phase-2 (final presentations) for the DB India Excellence Awards for 2024, recognizing the work I've done with the TDI India Junior Network. We are awaiting the results.

Team Achievements and Feedback:

Our team was the runner-up in the Reporting Domain Q2 2024 hackathon, showcasing our innovation and teamwork. I've also received valuable feedback from seniors and colleagues, which has been instrumental in my development and performance.

Alignment with Strategic Priorities:
These contributions align with the bank's strategic initiatives, including:
1. Supporting enterprise data management, RDA adoption, and BHW migration.
2. Developing our leadership culture, talent, and diversity, and embracing the leadership Kompass.
3. Progressing towards our target state platform and data architecture through application simplification, cloud migration, and COO adoption.
4. Meeting expectations as defined by the Profession and Role Framework and our discussions.
5. Evolving our operating model with a strong focus on agile practices, engineering excellence, production stability, and risk control.
6. Delivering on regulatory commitments, business outcomes, and benefits.

Conclusion:
I am committed to continuing my efforts in these areas and contributing to our team's and the bank's success in the second half of the year. Thank you for your guidance and support, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.
